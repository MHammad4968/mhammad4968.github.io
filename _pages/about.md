My name is Mohammad Hammad. I am a Freshman, majoring in Computer Science at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 

I am particularly interested in the field of Machine Learning and hope to pursue an advanced degree in the field.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
